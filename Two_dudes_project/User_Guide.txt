Inital Set-up:
This program uses Graphviz in order to create the visual representation of the decision tree.
We had issues getting this to run outside of an IDE and had to follow these steps in order for 
the classifier to generate the png through the command line.

1. If you do not have Graphviz installed on your machine please go to 
   https://graphviz.org/download/ and install. Please select to add path 
   to windows system path for all users and reboot.
2. Once installed open a command prompt with Administrative rights and 
   perform dot -c (this command is expecting graphviz binaries to be in your path)

Test Run:
1.  From a windows command prompt or from an IDE navigate to the folder containing
    CS4373_Project_TwoDudes.py

2.  You will be presented a simple text menu:
    Please choose any choice from below -

    (1) Load Dataset
    (2) Decision Tree Induction
    (3) Naive Bayes Classifier
    (4) KNN Classifier
    (5) Exit the Application

3.  Type: 1

4.  You will be directed to input a csv filename
    Input a csv file to load, please include file name and .csv extension

5.  Type: pc_purchase.csv

6.  You will be asked if you would like to view the contents of your file
    Type: y

7.  You will be asked if you would like to perform more operations
    Type: y

8.  You will be brought to the main menu
    Type: 2

9.  You will be presented with the Decision Tree Classifier menu
    Your decision tree has loaded!
    Please choose any choice from below -

    (1) View Graphical Tree
    (2) View Text Tree
    (3) Test the Accuracy of the Tree
    (4) Generate a prediction based on a tuple
    (5) Test built in classifier
    (6) Return to Main

10. type: 1
    a window should open displaying the graphical representation of the tree if it does not we 
    have provided a sample png with the project of a tree generated by this program.

11. Do you want to perform more decision tree operations? (y / n)
    type: y

12. type: 2
    a text based representation of the tree  will be displayed

13. type: y

14. type: 3
    the prediction accuracy of the tree on the testing set will be performed and displayed as a percentage

15. type: y

16. type: 4
    still need to do

17. type: y

18. type: 5
    the prediction accuracy of the built in functionality will be displayed as a percentage

20. type: 6
    returned to main menu

21. type: 3
    You will be brought to the Naive Bayes Classifier Menu

22. You will be presented with the Naive Bayes Classifier Menu

    (1) Test Accuracy
    (2) Make prediction
    (3) Return to Main

23. type: 1
    This will test the accuracy of the trained Naive Bayes Classifier against testing data

24. You'll be presented with the results
    Accuracy of Naive Bayes Model = 66.0

25. Do you want to perform more naive bayes operations? (y / n)
    You'll be presented with the following menu asking if you want to use the
    Naive Bayes Classifier again. In my case I will.

26. type: y

27. You'll again be presented with the bayes menu

    (1) Test Accuracy
    (2) Make prediction
    (3) Return to Main

28. type: 2
